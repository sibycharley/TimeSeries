# TimeSeries

The project basically gives a prototypical implementation of carrying out Time series classification using LSTM.
Implemnetation is done to support multi class(4 classes) classification and code utilizes the Keras Library with Tensorflow as backend
Project consists of 3 native source files, with additional files dataset files generated out of the code.
